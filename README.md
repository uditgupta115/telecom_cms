# Apps #
## Created two Apps : Customer & Subscription ##
### Storing Customer details in Customer Table & Subscription data in subscription ###
### Also, created one table CustomerSubscription and exposed through Django Admin ###

# API #
### Created an API endpoint for _customer-subscription_ for CRUD application and handling customer through a customer middleware ###


# Test Cases #

### written a few test cases to validate the app data because of time constraint only, I have limited myself like can write testcases for validating the API endpoints payload. ###


### About renewal handling, I handled in CustomerSubscription model itself and one plan of one type can be active at one time only, though yes, this can be written in some better ways###
